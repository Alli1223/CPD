# comp240-production
#Five Main issues that arose this year:
Even distribution of workload / not getting caught up in a project I like.
More reading of papers and books.
Learning new game engine.




# Semester Two CPD

## Week One
This week we came up with an initial design for the comp 260 Distributed systems sever.
We also covered what AI is, and have started thinking about what to work on for my AI portfolio project.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Getting back into the rhythm of working from the Christmas break.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Spend more time in the studio next week.

## Week Two
Missed Mondays lecture due to health issues.
Tuesday spent in studio working on comp240-production tasks. & AI lecture.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Getting started on the comp240-production is really challenging as I am not too sure where to start, because the game has changed so much over the last few weeks.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Over the coming week I will go over the changes they have made and try and understand them.

## Week Three
Monday spent working more on the comp260-server which I have started to work on the database that is needed for the server to store game data.
This has turned out to be quite challenging as setting up SQL and Java within eclipse is actually rather hard to get working, as you need to get JDBC drivers that will connect to the database.
Missed Tuesdays lecture. However I have booked a tutor meeting to go over the comp 250 AI proposal that I have come up with.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Understanding how to integrate SQL into Java.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will try and find some tutorials over the weekend and try and get a basic SQL database connected to the server by the beginning of next week.

## Week Four
Spent Monday working collaboratively on the server task, and I realized that I have a lot of work to do on it by next week.
Spent Tuesday working on my comp150-AI portfolio project, I really like the idea that I have for it at the moment which is a 2D top-down simulation game, where each agent in the game has needs such as sleep, hunger etc, and they need to seek out facilities on a ship. This will all be done using a Behavior Tree.
Worked on the server more as a group in Penryn on Thursday, made a little bit of progress.
Friday I worked a little bit more on the server to make it thread safe.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Understanding Thread safety.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Read the book about concurrency in Java.

## Week Five
Sprint review for comp240 was first thing Monday, which I have not done enough work as I would of liked to on it.
Then we spent the rest of the day finishing off the server that was due at 5PM. I feel like I did not contribute a lot towards the networking of the server, which I may have been quite good at, but other people were working on it instead. I managed to get the database storing questions and answers in one database and the players score in another. However my code could have been made a lot more efficient I feel like it is now thread safe.
Tuesday I was talking to the new lecturer Brian about our CPD tasks and report from last semester and working out where I would like to go after uni.
Wednesday I was working on the AI project which is going pretty well at the moment, I have multiple agents spawning in and they can calculate their own paths. The lecture on Wednesday from the AI researchers was also very useful as some of the ideas mentioned by one of them gave me a good idea about how to go about implementing AI into my AI project. 

### Problems I encountered this week:
Motivation to work on my comp240 project.
Where and how to start implementing a behavior tree for my AI project

### How I aim to overcome these issues: 
Over the coming week open the comp240 project and create a diagram of how it works so I can understand what is going on.
Do some research on the internet to see how it can be done.


## Week Six
Spent most of this week on AI pathfinding.
I am really enjoying working on pathfinding as it is very satisfying to watch thousands of agents in a level wander around.


### problems I encountered this week:
Getting vectors to work in C++ as the way I was moving the agents was very basic.

### How I aim to overcome these issues: 
Do some reading up online about how others have done it and apply that to my game.


## Week Seven
Worked on creating business presentation
Presented it on Friday, but I am very bad a public speaking. Furthermore I am not working with the BA team for the comp240 networking stuff as they cut that feature from their game.

### Problems I encountered this week:
I ran into a few errors with beamer to create the presentation, this was related to inserting images into a slide.
Presenting in front of people is something I find very challenging.

### How I aim to overcome these issues :
In the future play around with beamer and learn how to do essential things like inserting images and tables.
I guess just practicing talking to large crows is the only way I can thing of to overcome these.


## Week Eight
Monday was sprint review for comp240 (need to do a lot more)
Started comp260 client
Worked on comp250 Wednesday Thursday.
Had PCG lecture.
Behind on a lot of the writing stuff.

###problems I encountered tis week:
Getting my head around AI behavior trees.
Also learning how to get a client to connect to the server using the boost C++ library.


### How I aim to overcome these issues:
do some research about how other people have implemented behavior trees in C++ and try and implement that into my AI project.
Also do some more reading on behavior trees.
Do some more reading up on the boost website about how to implement it.


## Week Nine
Monday we had a lecture on networking and business stuff.
Tuesday peer review on AI which is due next week.
Worked on the market research Wednesday and Thursday. 
Spent the rest of the week working on the AI to tidy the code up.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Extremely unmotivated to work on comp240 production. I have no interest at all in what I am working on and since the team has stopped doing multiplayer it seems pointless. 
Lots of things need to be improved for the AI as I feel that a lot of the code is not done "properly" and is just the fastest way to get it working.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Try and start working on the project to see if I can get into the flow of working on it again.
Refactor a few of the AI features to improve some of the patchy code.


## Week Ten
Monday was peer review of market evaluation essay which I got some very helpful feedback for.
Spent Monday afternoon working on getting a base project working for the client.
Tuesday was review of research proposal.
Spend the rest of the week working on finishing research proposals and business essays.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Leaving the research journals to the last minute.
Not doing enough of the required reading till near the end and having to do a lot of reading when I should just be writing about what I read.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Do the required reading for next year over the summer and the start of the project, not near the deadline.


## Week Eleven
Monday Was sprint review for 240 project which I have done very little for, because of last week being deadlines for other projects that I have been prioritizing.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Working on projects that I enjoy again, instead of working on projects that need to be worked on.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will try and dedicate half of the Easter break to working on the project to get something to show for the final product.

##Easter Week One
Spend most of the first week of Easter working on the client-server connection and managing the issues that arose with that project.

### Problems I encountered this week:
There have been a lot of problems with implementing boost ASIO into my project, such as getting the networking done in another thread. I spend a lot of time trying everything to get it working with no luck.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will do some more reading up about how others have implemented boost threading, so I can get the networking done concurrently. 

##Easter Week two
Spent most of week two working on the comp 240 production project.

### Problems I encountered this week:
I came across a lot of problems when I was trying to take certain features from one unity scene from one build of the project to another build. For example comping a map terrain from one project to another so I can have multiple maps in one build.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
I overcame this issue by searching the internet for how others managed to do it and following some unity tutorials. 

##Week Twelve
Presented the final comp240 prototype to the first and second years, it went quite well as I had a working build that some people play tested and walked around the map.
Also had vivas for the comp260 project which I got to quite a nicely polished stage, where multiple clients can connect and their positions are synced up.
Spend the rest of the week continuing the development of the client server project, and I will most likely continue the development of it over the summer to try and create an actual multiplayer game.
