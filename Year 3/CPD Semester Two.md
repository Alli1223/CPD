# CPD

## Week One
Monday we had a lecture about research and research methods.

Tuesday I spent working on the dissertation artefact and finding a suitable project for the dissertation module.

Wednesday I worked on my old summer project as I was thinking of using that for the optimization task, but i'll see if that is the case on Friday when I speak to the lecturer.

Thursday we had a crit of our game, and we haven't got any textured art assets in our game at the moment, so the programmers got taught a few 3D modeling techniques to quickly create some textured models for our game.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Trying to find a suitable project for the optimization module
* Issues with re-learning how to use R
* 

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* Talk to the lecturer about that I would like to do for the optimization module on Friday to clarify what project I can do it on.
* Over the weekend I will gather more data from the GVG-AI competition so on Monday when we have a lecture about data collection I will have some data to use and get some help analyzing in R.
*
