# CPD

## Week One
Monday we had a lecture about research and research methods.

Tuesday I spent working on the dissertation artefact and finding a suitable project for the dissertation module.

Wednesday I worked on my old summer project as I was thinking of using that for the optimization task, but i'll see if that is the case on Friday when I speak to the lecturer.

Thursday we had a crit of our game, and we haven't got any textured art assets in our game at the moment, so the programmers got taught a few 3D modeling techniques to quickly create some textured models for our game.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Trying to find a suitable project for the optimization module
* Issues with re-learning how to use R


### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* Talk to the lecturer about that I would like to do for the optimization module on Friday to clarify what project I can do it on.
* Over the weekend I will gather more data from the GVG-AI competition so on Monday when we have a lecture about data collection I will have some data to use and get some help analyzing in R.


## Week Two
Monday we had a lecture about research methodologies, which I feel a lot of it went over my head, I will need to read the lecture slides again at some point because the content will help with the structure of my dissertation. In the afternoon we had the lecture about optimization and porting where we did some stuff with the PS4 that I'm not sure if I can talk about on here?
I'm still slightly unsure about how well my game will port to the PS4 though, as I have quite a few additional libraries that might not be supported. I will need to message Brian in the week before the proposal hand in date.

Tuesday I had a tutor meeting and discussed how my projects are doing, then spent the afternoon trying to get a json file loaded into r to be analyzed. 

Wednesday I was stuck at home because the busses weren't running due to ice. So I spent a bit of the day working on the optimization proposal.

Thursday I had a PO meeting that didn't go great, as the attendance of our team is pretty poor, but my poor attendance is due to working on other projects at home or in the library where it is quieter.
The scope of the game has changed because of that, and we are now doing hotseat multiplayer, so the saving system I was working on isn't needed anymore..
I have now started looking into doing cell shading and a fog of war system for the game.


### Problems I encountered this week:
* Unsure about the complexity of my optimization project
* lack of results for the dissertation
* Having to stop working on a part of the group game because the scope of the game has changed

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* Send Brian a slack message on Wednesday to see if he can clarify the scope of my project before the deadline Friday.
* By the beginning of next week I will aim to get some preliminary results from the artifact that I can show to my supervisor.
* I will look into shaders within unity so I can start implementing some cell shading and fog of war.


## Week Three
Monday I started the research journal for the optimisation task, which I am researching STL Containers and Algorithms.

Tuesday we had the meeting with Rich and Martin, and Martin was really helpful for our team and tried to help us get back on track, where as Rich just seems to kill any team motivation.

Wednesday I had a meeting with Brian about the team project, because apparently Rich is concerned about my work or something, even though he has never spoken to me about it. So Brian said he's going to see why that happened..

Thursday we had a team PO meeting and a crit, which was another artist lecturer, so he was trying to help us get some basic textures on our models.

Friday I spent a bit of time working on the dissertation.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* I've had to change what I am working on for the team game again for the third week in a row, as whatever I have been working on has been cut from the game.
* The team game is not coming along well, but I feel like this isn't mine or toms fault because we put in the hours needed for the module, but this doesn't seem to be enough, but then the group module is taking up a lot of my time when it is only worth like 1/4 of one module.
* spent most of the week working on the group game, when I really need to focus on my dissertation at the moment.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* I am now working on something that is critical to the games functionality for a minimum viable product, so this should not get cut again before I am able to finish it.
* I am going to focus more next week on the modules that are going to contribute more towards my final grade.
* Next week I will try to dedicate more time to the dissertation


## Week Four

Monday we had a lecture about data collection for our dissertation which was helpful, I'm glad I didn't choose to involve people in my dissertation because that would add a lot more work on top of the data gathering for the competition.

Tuesday I spent working on my dissertation and getting some basic results for the optimisation task.

Spent the rest of the week working on various tasks.


###Problems I encountered this week:
* Lack of motivation to go in to the studio to work
* Lack of communication with team members

###How I aim to overcome theses issues:
* I will try and communicate more next week when I have studio hours.



## Week Five
Monday we had peer review of optimization task, and had to reschedule my supervisor meeting for a while.

Tuesday I spent at home working on my website and CV as the peer review for that is fairly soon.

Wednesday I went to Gareth's lecture, where we went over other peers CVs and websites, then got snowed in the studio and spend Thursday at home because I couldn't get to studio.

Friday I spent working on my optimization task, which I am really getting into, I spent that evening refactoring my rendering, so my game now uses an atlas to load textures in.

Spent most of the weekend working on the optimization task, it seems to be fairly slow going, as refactoring code seems to take up more time than the writeup.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* No productivity on group game due to snow
* I feel a bit behind on my dissertation, as I have no results yet, and there is a presentation coming up very soon for it.
* There is so much work that needs to get done in parallel, its getting rather overwhelming.


### How I aim to overcome this tissues:
* Next week I will dedicate more of my time to the group game, and dissertation.
* I will aim to spend the start of the week on the group game, and the rest of the week working on dissertation stuff, ready for the presentation.
* I will try and spend a few nights in the campus library to work on the dissertation stuff.


## Week Six
Monday I spent 9-5 in the studio, doing a little bit of work on everything. I got some cell shading working in unity, but I didn't speak to the team about the game really, I just kinda worked on my own.

Tuesday I spent 9-2 in the studio mainly working on website stuff, as that is really enjoyable, and a nice break from the other work that is getting quite rough atm.

Wednesday we had a lecture with Gareth about how to network in the industry, this was super insightful, as Gareth seems to know his stuff.

Thursday I spent working on the dissertation artefact, and made some progress with the rendering of the agents positions.

Friday I started trying to load some basic data into R, but it takes so long to do anything in R, as they tried to make it easy to do stuff, but I keep running into edge cases that take me ages to work out how to fix.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Struggling to load stuff into R
* Not sure what content to put in my slides for Monday, as I don't really have any results yet.
* I have been thinking about changing my dissertation topic slightly, towards modifications to MCTS, rather than different tree search techniques.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* I will look over the slides from the previous weeks on statistical analysis, to see what I can put into the slides.
* Over the weekend I will try and get some basic graphs for the presentation.
* I will speak to Ed on Monday to discuss how I can take my dissertation forward.

## Week Seven
I spent the weekend stressing over my dissertation, because I was unsure where to take it, and I still needed results for Monday.
I had a meeting with Ed on Monday, where I decided to focus my dissertation on MCTS modifications. The presentation wasn't as bad as I was expecting.
The group game seems to be falling apart again, as me, Tom and Sam were the only ones in the studio all day, and rich sent a strongly worded email to the team about attendance.

We also got an email about the peer review for the market research, which was on my timetable for next week, has been moved to Tuesday, so it's gunna be another busy night working on my website and market evaluation.

Tuesday we had a peer review of the market evaluation forms.

Wednesday was the 3rd year show and tell, which was kind of embarrassing, as my team put very little effort into the trailer. And they seemed to have cut the trailer off while doing the presentation, so all our work, and gameplay wasn't showed.

Thursday I decided to stay home and get some work done on the market evaluation and website. 
Friday I worked on the dissertation, to try and get some results, although I did come up with the idea of running the simulations on my server, so I am now running the thousands of games on my cloud Linux server, which should get me some results for next week.

Saturday I spent all day in the studio working on shaders for the group game, then spent all night in the library working on the research journal and wiki, as well as a little bit on optimisation and website.

Sunday I spent resting

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Show and tell was awful
* Still so much work to get done

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* I spent the weekend solidy working on the research journal and wiki, so that is one less thing I have to do next week.
* The group game shader component is coming along pretty well this week, so I will aim to get that done a bit more over easter.

## Week Eight
* Monday we had optimisation research peer review
* Tuesday was spent working on Market evaluation and had a peer review for that.
* Rest of the week was spent polishing the optimisation research and market evaluation.

## Easter Break Week 1
Spend this week traveling home and spend it with my family

## Easter Break Week 2
Spent the start of the week working on a new programming project, which I know is poor timing, I just had a really nice idea for a game that I wanted to work on. 

Wednesday I spent in the library working on the optimisation and dissertation projects.

### Problems I encountered over the holidays:
* Motivation issues, i.e. lack of focus to spend time programming on uni work.

## Week Nine
Monday had a Peer review for Optimisation task and a supervisor meeting

Tuesday and wednesday I was in the studio working on the group game from 10-5, and also working on the disseratation and optimisation task.

Thursday I was working on dissertation stuff to start getting results, we also had a PO meeting for the group game, which is actially starting to make some good progress, as the game can actually be finished now.

Friday was spent working on optimisation for the hand in at 5, I found it quite hard to document all the changes that I made to the game, as there were a lot of minor changes that were left undocumented.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Spent a lot of the week trying to get shaders working for the group game, as nothing of mine has been put into the game yet.
* The shaders are taking a lot of time to get working, and am finding it hard to balance time between this, optimisation and dissertation this week.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* Next week I will spend the first half of the week working on dissertation and getting some results that I can start writing about in my dissertation, then the last half of the week I will spend getting the fog of war shader working for the group game.

## Week Ten
Monday I spent wokring on dissertation and trying to get some results from my data.

Tuesday had supervisor meeting where I realised how behind I am on the dissertation, I have 20 days to et my results nad finish the write up.

Wednesday I spent the morning working on the porting task, with no luck, had a lecture in the afternoon, and spent the evening in the studio working on the group game, because apparently we are content locking soon.

Thursday we had PO meeting with andy, and I spent a while installing ubuntu to the memory sticks ready for this weekened.

Friday I set up the computers in the studio with ubuntu, and started the simulations, to leave for the weekend.

spent the weekend trying to work on disseratation stuff

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Need to spend more time working on dissertation as well as group game.
I currenly don't have anything in the game that I made yet, and we are content locking soon, so I need to dedicate a lot of this week and next to get my fog of war system working for our game.
* Installing java on the memory sticks too way too long, it took me about 2 hours to install java to get my program running, this was due to ubuntu 17 being broken when running from the memory stick, and had to re-install all the memory sticks with ubuntu 16.04. Further more the version of java that it was compiled with was java jdk 9, which i found is no longer supported, and is now insead java 10.
* I am currently feeling really fatigued with the disseratation project, I feel like im really behind, and the task ahead in the next two weeks is so daunting to get it all finished.
* The software artefact isn't anything I am proud of, and it is really messy, hopefully I can tidy it up before submission.

### How I aim to over these issues:
* notsure :/

## Week Eleven
Monday I arrived in the studio early, to find out that the computers running my simulation had ran out of memory, so I only got the results from 2 games, instead of 100 i'm suppose to get.

Tuesday I had a meeting with Ed, where he said it might be a good idea to write a python program to run the simulations, so each game runs in its own java executable.

Wedensday I was working on the group game project, and finally fixed the shaer issue and commited that to perforce. I then got home and created the python simulaion launcher, which was actually really fun to make, I think I will start getting back into using python, as using concurrency in python was very easy to use.

Thursday I spent working on the group game stuff and trying to get the porting to work, with no luck.

Friday was the group game hand in, where the team said they were going to hand it in on wednesday, they ended up handing it in 5 minutes before the deadline, this was due to a game breaking bug when building the project, which the team really should have done before, not 30mins before the deadline.
I also spent the rest of the evening with Brian trying to work out why my porting task wasnt working, this was due to the wrong version of phyreEngine being installed for the wrong SDK on the PS4 dev kit.
I also started learning how to port my game to android.

Saturday I spent working on dissertation stuff

Sunday I..

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Still have very little to show for the dissertation, with 10 days left!
* Porting task has creeped up very quickly, and I also have to get that done by monday!
* Simulations ran out of memory.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* I will aim to write up most of my dissertation over the weekend, as the simulations are currently running, and won't be done for a while.
* Fixed the memory issue by creating a python program to run the games
* Need to wait till the weekend to compile the results from the simulations

### Week twelve
Monday I spent from 8-6 in the studio working on getting porting task done, however it wasn't up to a very good standard.

Tuesday had a supervisor meeting which was super helpful, and I now have a better idea how to summarize my paper. I also spent the afternoon with Tom, putting the game demo video together.

Wednesday I had a rest day, as the last two weeks have been v. stressful, so just needed to chill out a bit, and spend the day customising my laptops ubuntu themes, to make it look beautiful.

Thursday spent all night working on the disertation, and progress is very slow still. Handed in the group game in the morning, I am kind of worried about that submission, as my contribution to the group game is minimal.

Friday spent most of the day resting from thursday, spent friday night working on dissertation again, as well as saturday and sunday.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Minimal contribution to group game submission
* No user stories for group game
* Minimal progress towards dissertation


### Week thirteen
Monday
