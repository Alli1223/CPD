# CPD

## Week One
Monday we had a lecture about research and research methods.

Tuesday I spent working on the dissertation artefact and finding a suitable project for the dissertation module.

Wednesday I worked on my old summer project as I was thinking of using that for the optimization task, but i'll see if that is the case on Friday when I speak to the lecturer.

Thursday we had a crit of our game, and we haven't got any textured art assets in our game at the moment, so the programmers got taught a few 3D modeling techniques to quickly create some textured models for our game.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Trying to find a suitable project for the optimization module
* Issues with re-learning how to use R


### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* Talk to the lecturer about that I would like to do for the optimization module on Friday to clarify what project I can do it on.
* Over the weekend I will gather more data from the GVG-AI competition so on Monday when we have a lecture about data collection I will have some data to use and get some help analyzing in R.


## Week Two
Monday we had a lecture about research methodologies, which I feel a lot of it went over my head, I will need to read the lecture slides again at some point because the content will help with the structure of my dissertation. In the afternoon we had the lecture about optimization and porting where we did some stuff with the PS4 that I'm not sure if I can talk about on here?
I'm still slightly unsure about how well my game will port to the PS4 though, as I have quite a few additional libraries that might not be supported. I will need to message Brian in the week before the proposal hand in date.

Tuesday I had a tutor meeting and discussed how my projects are doing, then spent the afternoon trying to get a json file loaded into r to be analyzed. 

Wednesday I was stuck at home because the busses weren't running due to ice. So I spent a bit of the day working on the optimization proposal.

Thursday I had a PO meeting that didn't go great, as the attendance of our team is pretty poor, but my poor attendance is due to working on other projects at home or in the library where it is quieter.
The scope of the game has changed because of that, and we are now doing hotseat multiplayer, so the saving system I was working on isn't needed anymore..
I have now started looking into doing cell shading and a fog of war system for the game.


### Problems I encountered this week:
* Unsure about the complexity of my optimization project
* lack of results for the dissertation
* Having to stop working on a part of the group game because the scope of the game has changed

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* Send Brian a slack message on Wednesday to see if he can clarify the scope of my project before the deadline Friday.
* By the beginning of next week I will aim to get some preliminary results from the artifact that I can show to my supervisor.
* I will look into shaders within unity so I can start implementing some cell shading and fog of war.
