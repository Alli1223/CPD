\section{Career Goals}
This is my final year studying at university, and a chance to put the skills I have learnt over the previous years to use. 

This report will cover the issues I have had over the first semester and propose SMART goals to help resolve the challenges I faced this year.
The key challenges raised below are based of the most common issues found in my weekly CPD report.
%SMART actions to resolve these issues


\section{Summary of Key Challenges}

%%%% Challenge 1

% Communication of what I am working on to group team when I am not present for scrum meetings
% Getting hung up on a task for a long time, and not switch to another one.
\subsection{Communication within a team}

% Justification and importance
Communication within a team is critical to the success of a project, especially within the games and software development industry communication within large teams is vital.
Over this semester there were a few instances of where I would not keep the team in the loop as to what I was working on for their game.

% How the issue affects my work
This lead to the team not thinking that I was doing any work for them, and also if I got stuck on something for a while, the team might have been able to help.
This also leads on to the challenge of leaving a problem I am struggling with, as mentioned in section \ref{Leaving}.
This affected my work and the work of my team, because if I had kept my team in the loop on what I was doing every day, they would know where I was at with each feature of the game.
or didn't know where to start with an mechanic
