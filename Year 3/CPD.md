#CPD

## Week One
Lectures on Monday
Tuesday I spent working on a prototype to get render textures working in unity, then had a product owner meeting with the BA team.

Wednesday I spent working on the prototype more and got movement and camera controls working correctly. 

Thursday I spent working more on the FPS mech prototype, then had a crit, which we decided to scrap the prototype I was working on because it was too simple for the amount of programmers we have.

Friday we had a meeting about what CV and portfolio stuff we have, and what we would like to do after this year.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Spent very little time working on the Research practice and most of my time working on a prototype for the BA team.

### How I aim to solve these problems:
Next Week I will prioritize getting my research question narrowed down, by reading lots of papers on GVG-AI.

## Week two
Monday had lecture about Research practices and about the De-Make project.
Tuesday I had a PO meeting in which we said that the prototype I was working on has got scrapped and we are now working on the x com style game.
Wednesday we had a scrum meeting in which we decided to break the x com style game down in to little pieces and I have to work on the mission selector and cover mechanics.
Thursday I had a crit with Phoebe in which we all sort of decided that the FPS prototype I was working on was too simple for the amount of programmers we had in our group.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Trying to work out what to work on for the BA game, because I'm not too sure where to start, when there is nothing in the current prototype.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Find a part of the game that I can work on next week, such as customisation or UI stuff as I am quite familiar with that in unity, so could do that quite quickly.

## Week Three
Monday Presented de make project, which I have chosen to demake the game Overcooked.
Tuesday I had PO meeting in which we didn't have much to show, but that was because I was working on a prototype that got scrapped and hadn't had anything to work on for the new prototype.
Wednesday I worked on the new protypes mission selector, then had two lectures, one of them being a guest lecture by one of the metamakers.
Thursday I spent reading academic papers.
Friday I got the mission selector working in unity, and had a meeting with AL about my website and portfolio stuff.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Didn't manage my time well between the three modules.

### How I aim to solve these problems:
Next week I will only spend time working on the BA game in the specified timetabled slots, and spend more time working on getting a research question sorted and leading assembly programming.


## Week Four
Monday we had a lecture on more assembly programming for the 6502 in which I learnt more about the more maintainable ways to manage the source code in large games.

Tuesday I spent working on the first draft of my literature review and trying to find more papers about my dissertation topic.
Wednesday I Spent working on the group game
Thursday I had a crit and worked more on the group game.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Getting motivated to start the undercooked game, because it seems very daunting at the moment.

###How I aim to solve these problems:
I will read the Nerdy Nights 6502 tutorial that Ed suggested, and see if I can get a background rendering before next week.


##Week Five
Ed coverd more Assembly on Monday, which was actually super helpful, as he coverd shooting merchanics, and although my game doesn't have shooting, I can see how to implement some of the functionality from his work.
Tudsday I spent working on the cover system for the BA game, in which I am not too sure how to approach it, I started using ray casting to determine if the player is in cover or not, but that approach could lead to the game being buggy at times, and is more physics based, and less grid based, which is what the team wants.
Wednesday I spent reading papers and preparing some papers that are relevant to show ed tomorrow.
Thursday Ed helped with my literature review idea, and I will try and have a rough draft ready for next week.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Not too sure how to implement the cover merchanic for the BA game.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Over the studio practice times next week I will try and understand Marcs grid system he made in unity, and implement a cover system into that. 

##Week Six
Spent Monday catching up with tasks that I have let slip me by, such as the 310 community Wiki and this CPD, as well as work on the literature review draft.

Spent Tuesday working on comp310
Spent Wednesday working on literature review draft
Spent Thursday working on website and portfolio stuffs
Spent Friday working on CV and getting a CV template set up in latex because the CV I made in word looked rubbish.

Problems I encountered this week:
Didn't do as much work on the literature review as I should of by now.
General lack of work this week because of various distractions.

How I aim to overcome these issues:
Work over the weekend to catch up on the work I am behind on.

## Week Seven
Monday I presented my literature review, which didn't go as badly as I was expecting. There were a few notes about my presentation, such as not much eye contact with the class when presenting and my slides had too much text on them. However I feel my presentation skills have improved since first year.

Tuesday I had a supervisor meeting which helped me with how I am going to structure my essay and some more content to put in it.

Wednesday I spent working on my dissertation, and managed to get a fair bit done, however I sill have a lot more to do before the peer review on Monday.


Thursday I went into the studio to get perforce set up, but was unsuccessful as my laptop had issues connecting to the perforce server, however it seems most of the team isn't using perforce yet, so I will try again next week to get that set up.

Friday was the deadline for the CV and portfolio stuff.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* I had issues correctly formatting my CV in latex.
* The peer review for the website was a few hours before the deadline so there wasn't enough time to make meaningful changes based off peer feedback.



### How I aim to overcome these issues:
.In future I will ask for peer feedback of my work before the deadline so that it's not left till last minute, this also allows me to reformat things such as my CV and website in a much more meaningful way.


## Week Eight
Most of this week was spent working on the research literature review as the deadline was on Friday.
On Tuesday I had a tutor meeting where I went over the current state of my literature review, I still have a lot of work to do to get it complete, as Ed gave a lot of useful feedback.

Wednesday to Friday I spent on revising my literature review. I ended up spending a bit too much time on the formatting of the essay than the content, for example I spent at least 3-4 hours the night before just adding the UCB math formula in latex.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Made a few typos in my literature review due to last minute revisions the night before.
* Spent too long learning new features within latex, i.e. formulas and figures rather than writing the essay.


### How I aim to overcome these issues:
I managed to fix the issue by googling the issue instead of trying to work it out on my own, which I should of done from the start and I will try and do more often rather than waste time.


## Week Nine
Most of this week was spent working on the demake which was due in on Friday.
However on Monday we went over the literature reviews, which I was shown where I made a few issues with my essay. The feedback was very useful and will feed forward into my dissertation.
I did not spend enough time working on the demake though as I found a lot of the mechanics I am suppose to implement quite challenging.
I ended up spending too much time on the aesthetics of the game opposed to the mechanics. 


### Problems I encountered this week:
* Lack of motivation to address the issues with my demake
* Spreading my time equally between the different modules

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* I will try and ask for more help when I do not know where to start with a mechanic, such as in the demakes.
* I will try over the next few weeks till the end of the semester to work on the last few modules equally, but prioritize the work that is due sooner.


## Week Ten
Most of this week was spent working on the group game and research artefact.
Tuesday I worked on the group project and tried to get perforce working on my laptop again, with no luck. I also had a supervisor meeting where I went of the GVG-AI framework and went over a few of the issues that I have been having with that, where the AI will just stand idle. This ended up being because the search function was not able to return the UCT value because it spent all of its time searching and didn't leave anytime to get the results. With a fix by Ed we got the competition framework working correctly.
Wednesday I worked on the saving and loading of game saves within the group game.
Thursday I had the PO meeting and worked more on the group game and got perforce working on the studio machines.


### Problems I encountered this week:
* Learning how to commit and view changes within perforce.
* Getting perforce set up on my laptop
* Learning how the GVG-AI framework works, in depth.


### How I aim to overcome these issues:
I will talk to a technician either later today or tomorrow to get perforce set up on my laptop, and will talk to my team about the best practices of using perforce.
Over the weekend and next week I will try and get some preliminary results for my dissertation from the GVG-AI competition by adding some graphics features that will overlay when the AI competition runs. 



## Week Eleven
Monday I spent working on the saving system for the group game, and managed to get a basic saving system working. We also had a crit with Ed which went fine.
Tuesday we had a PO meeting with rich which went pretty well, he seems happy with the progress we are making so far.
Wednesday I worked on getting cell shading working with the unity test build.
Thursday I worked on the comp330 preproduction tasks and made a poster and handout for the items .

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Having time to focus on the research artifact
* Re-learning graphics shader code.

### How I aim to overcome these issues
* Next week I dedicate to the research artifact and the preproduction video
* 


## Week Twelve
I had a supervisor meeting which helped clarify which direction I should head with my research artifact and dissertation.
I didn't add much to the group game this week as I was working on the research artifact.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Motivation to focus on work when the holidays is so near.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* Have set targets throughout the holidays to get some results for the viva week when we get back.

## Xmas Holiday

## H1
Didn't get much work done at the beginning of the week as I was traveling and getting set up back at home.
Worked on getting visualizations working for the framework, I am having quite a few issues getting my head around recursion, because I haven't really touched it before and I have had a few issues with recursively searching the game search tree.
However I created a visualizations class for the framework and got the cells that have been searched getting rendered. One issue I have had with this is that MCTS only seems to be searching 4-5 cells within the game space, which seems far too small to what I thought it should be searching.

### Problems I encountered this week:
* Trying to figure out how to recursively a game search tree.
* Implementing new classes and working out what functions to use within the GVG-AI framework.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
* I found some online resources that helped me get my head around recursively searching a tree.

## H2
Didn't get any work done this week.

## H3
Spent week 3 traveling back to Falmouth and getting the CPD and reflective report done for the peer review Friday, which I didn't realize was being done.
