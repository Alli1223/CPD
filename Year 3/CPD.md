#CPD

## Week One
Lectures on Monday
Tuesday I spent working on a prototype to get render textures working in unity, then had a product owner meeting with the BA team.

Wednesday I spent working on the prototype more and got movement and camera controls working correctly. 

Thursday I spent working more on the FPS mech prototype, then had a crit, which we decided to scrap the prototype I was working on because it was too simple for the amount of programmers we have.

Friday we had a meeting about what CV and portfolio stuff we have, and what we would like to do after this year.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Spent very little time working on the Research practice and most of my time working on a prototype for the BA team.

### How I aim to solve these problems:
Next Week I will prioritize getting my research question narrowed down, by reading lots of papers on GVG-AI.

## Week two
Monday had lecture about Research practices and about the De-Make project.
Tuesday I had a PO meeting in which we said that the prototype I was working on has got scrapped and we are now working on the x com style game.
Wednesday we had a scrum meeting in which we decided to break the x com style game down in to little pieces and I have to work on the mission selector and cover mechanics.
Thursday I had a crit with Phoebe in which we all sort of decided that the FPS prototype I was working on was too simple for the amount of programmers we had in our group.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Trying to work out what to work on for the BA game, because I'm not too sure where to start, when there is nothing in the current prototype.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Find a part of the game that I can work on next week, such as customisation or UI stuff as I am quite familiar with that in unity, so could do that quite quickly.

## Week Three
Monday Presented de make project, which I have chosen to demake the game Overcooked.
Tuesday I had PO meeting in which we didn't have much to show, but that was because I was working on a prototype that got scrapped and hadn't had anything to work on for the new prototype.
Wednesday I worked on the new protypes mission selector, then had two lectures, one of them being a guest lecture by one of the metamakers.
Thursday I spent reading academic papers.
Friday I got the mission selector working in unity, and had a meeting with AL about my website and portfolio stuff.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Didn't manage my time well between the three modules.

### How I aim to solve these problems:
Next week I will only spend time working on the BA game in the specified timetabled slots, and spend more time working on getting a research question sorted and leading assembly programming.
