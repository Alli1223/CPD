#CPD

## Week One
Lectures on Monday
Tuesday I spent working on a prototype to get render textures working in unity, then had a product owner meeting with the BA team.

Wednesday I spent working on the prototype more and got movement and camera controls working correctly. 

Thursday I spent working more on the FPS mech prototype, then had a crit, which we decided to scrap the prototype I was working on because it was too simple for the amount of programmers we have.

Friday we had a meeting about what CV and portfolio stuff we have, and what we would like to do after this year.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Spent very little time working on the Research practice and most of my time working on a prototype for the BA team.

### How I aim to solve these problems:
Next Week I will prioritize getting my research question narrowed down, by reading lots of papers on GVG-AI.

## Week two
Monday had lecture about Research practices and about the De-Make project.
Tuesday I had a PO meeting in which we said that the prototype I was working on has got scrapped and we are now working on the x com style game.
Wednesday we had a scrum meeting in which we decided to break the x com style game down in to little pieces and I have to work on the mission selector and cover mechanics.
Thursday I had a crit with Phoebe in which we all sort of decided that the FPS prototype I was working on was too simple for the amount of programmers we had in our group.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Trying to work out what to work on for the BA game, because I'm not too sure where to start, when there is nothing in the current prototype.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Find a part of the game that I can work on next week, such as customisation or UI stuff as I am quite familiar with that in unity, so could do that quite quickly.

## Week Three
Monday Presented de make project, which I have chosen to demake the game Overcooked.
Tuesday I had PO meeting in which we didn't have much to show, but that was because I was working on a prototype that got scrapped and hadn't had anything to work on for the new prototype.
Wednesday I worked on the new protypes mission selector, then had two lectures, one of them being a guest lecture by one of the metamakers.
Thursday I spent reading academic papers.
Friday I got the mission selector working in unity, and had a meeting with AL about my website and portfolio stuff.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Didn't manage my time well between the three modules.

### How I aim to solve these problems:
Next week I will only spend time working on the BA game in the specified timetabled slots, and spend more time working on getting a research question sorted and leading assembly programming.


## Week Four
Monday we had a lecture on more assembly programming for the 6502 in which I learnt more about the more maintainable ways to manage the source code in large games.

Tuesday I spent working on the first draft of my literature review and trying to find more papers about my dissertation topic.
Wednesday I Spent working on the group game
Thursday I had a crit and worked more on the group game.

###Problems I encountered this week:
Getting motivated to start the undercooked game, because it seems very daunting at the moment.

###How I aim to solve these problems:
I will read the Nerdy Nights 6502 tutorial that Ed suggested, and see if I can get a background rendering before next week.


##Week Five
Ed coverd more Assembly on Monday, which was actually super helpful, as he coverd shooting merchanics, and although my game doesn't have shooting, I can see how to implement some of the functionality from his work.
Tudsday I spent working on the cover system for the BA game, in which I am not too sure how to approach it, I started using ray casting to determine if the player is in cover or not, but that approach could lead to the game being buggy at times, and is more physics based, and less grid based, which is what the team wants.
Wednesday I spent reading papers and preparing some papers that are relevant to show ed tomorrow.
Thursday Ed helped with my literature review idea, and I will try and have a rough draft ready for next week.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Not too sure how to implement the cover merchanic for the BA game.

### How I aim to overcome these issues:
Over the studio practice times next week I will try and understand Marcs grid system he made in unity, and implement a cover system into that. 

##Week Six
Spent Monday catching up with tasks that I have let slip me by, such as the 310 community Wiki and this CPD, as well as work on the literature review draft.

Spent Tuesday working on comp310
Spent Wednesday working on literature review draft
Spent Thursday working on website and portfolio stuffs
Spent Friday working on CV and getting a CV template set up in latex because the CV I made in word looked rubbish.

Problems I encountered this week:
Didn't do as much work on the literature review as I should of by now.
General lack of work this week because of various distractions.

How I aim to overcome these issues:
Work over the weekend to catch up on the work I am behind on.
