#CPD

## Week One
Lectures on Monday
Tuesday I spent working on a prototype to get render textures working in unity, then had a product owner meeting with the BA team.

Wednesday I spent working on the prototype more and got movement and camera controls working correctly. 

Thursday I spent working more on the FPS mech prototype, then had a crit, which we decided to scrap the prototype I was working on because it was too simple for the amount of programmers we have.

Friday we had a meeting about what CV and portfolio stuff we have, and what we would like to do after this year.

### Problems I encountered this week:
Spent very little time working on the Research practice and most of my time working on a prototype for the BA team.

### How I aim to solve these problems:
Next Week I will prioritize getting my research question narrowed down, by reading lots of papers on GVG-AI.

## Week two
Monday had lecture about Research practices and about the De-Make project.
